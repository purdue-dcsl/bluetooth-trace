# Sample script
We have a sample_usage.py file for an easy hands-on check of the data.

# Data Format
1. The trace is a json file once you unzip it (trace.zip). In the unzipped json file, each user has a uniqued hashed id, e.g. 9e0356c01899ce49f002c995c08c306f6f75335aa8087448adb5eccc2333bdbd
2. The data for each user is sorted list of timestamp points. At each time point, it also records the location of the user (latitude, longitude) and the neighbor Bluetooth signals (rssi, mac address, advertisement name). The mac address and the advertisement name are both hashed to protect user privacy.
